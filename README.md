<h2 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sebastian</h2>


  ```cpp
  class Sebastian {
        private:
          int age = 20;
          string school = "Oregon State University";
          string[] courses = new string[] {"Senior Capstone Project, Operating Systems, Technical Writing"};
          string[] hobbies = new string[] {"Basketball", "Piano", "Doomscrolling"};
        public:
          Sebastian();
  }
  ```

Here are a few things I'm doing right now...

- Creating [a website](https://github.com/sebat2004/keysight) that generates Synesthesia-like piano tutorials from any piano audio
- Learning how to play songs like [Elfe by Dario Lessing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWe5ml8Zb74) and [Ashes on The Fire from AoT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Cp8laD5njk) on the piano
- Building my senior capstone project: a degree course planner called [Advise-U](https://github.com/AdviseU-Project) that validates and recommends optimal course plans for Oregon State University students
