<h2 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sebastian</h2>


  ```cpp
  class Sebastian {
        private:
          int age = 19;
          string school = "Oregon State University";
          string[] courses = new string[] {"Algorithms, Software Engineering I/II"};
          string[] hobbies = new string[] {"Basketball", "Piano", "Poker"};
        public:
          Sebastian();
  }
  ```

Here are a few things I'm doing right now...

- Creating [a website](https://github.com/sebat2004/keysight) that generates Synesthesia-like piano tutorials from any piano audio
- Learning how to play songs like [Unravel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEQf5lcnj_o) and [Moonlight Sonata 3rd Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUzwdBQDzxw) on the piano
- Refactoring an internal and customer-facing website during my internship at [Cboe](https://www.cboe.com/)
